# Project Development Prompts

## 1. Initial Setup and Basic Pipeline
Prompt: "Help me create a complete CI/CD pipeline for my ML project"
- Created basic model architecture (model.py)
- Set up training script (train.py)
- Created test cases (test_model.py)
- Added GitHub Actions workflow
- Created .gitignore

## 2. Model Parameter Optimization
Prompt: "My test cases are failing AssertionError: Model has 206922 parameters, should be < 100000"
- Reduced model architecture in model.py
- Decreased number of filters and neurons
- Optimized for <25,000 parameters

## 3. GitHub Actions Update
Prompt: "While running github action got following error: Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact: v2"
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow
- Upgraded actions/upload-artifact to v4
- Updated other GitHub Actions dependencies

## 4. High Accuracy Test Case
Prompt: "Add test case where check should done on accuracy of more than 95% in 1 Epoch"
- Added new test case in test_model.py
- Created test_model_high_accuracy function
- Set accuracy threshold to 95%

## 5. Image Augmentation
Prompt: "Add image augmentation also display the image augmentation for 1 image"
- Added data augmentation to train.py
- Implemented visualization function
- Added transforms: rotation, affine, perspective
- Created example image display functionality

## 6. Build Status Badge
Prompt: "After successful completion of github action job. Add 'build pass' Badge to README.md"
- Added GitHub Actions build status badge to README.md
- Updated documentation

## 7. Documentation Update
Prompt: "Update my prompt.txt file with all the prompts that i used to build this project"
- Created prompt.txt
- Documented all major development steps
- Added context for each prompt

Each prompt led to specific improvements and features in the project, creating a comprehensive ML pipeline with:
- Efficient model architecture
- Automated testing
- Data augmentation
- CI/CD integration
- Proper documentation
